class PlexAutoLanguages:
    """
    The main class that orchestrates the functionality of Plex Auto Languages.

    This class serves as the central coordinator for the application, managing the lifecycle
    of various components and handling the core application logic. It is responsible for:

    - Loading and managing configuration settings
    - Setting up health checks to monitor application status
    - Configuring notification services for alerts
    - Scheduling periodic tasks for maintenance operations
    - Establishing and maintaining connection to the Plex server
    - Handling graceful startup and shutdown procedures
    - Processing signals for proper application termination

    The class implements a robust error handling mechanism and automatic reconnection
    to ensure continuous operation even in case of temporary connection issues.

    Attributes:
        alive (bool): Indicates whether the application is active and running.
        must_stop (bool): Flags if the application should stop the current iteration.
        stop_signal (bool): Flags if a stop signal (e.g., SIGINT) was received.
        plex_alert_listener (PlexAlertListener): Listener for Plex server alerts.
        initializing (bool): Indicates if the application is in initialization phase.
        reconnect_delay (int): Current delay in seconds before reconnection attempts, with exponential backoff.
        config (Configuration): Configuration object containing application settings.
        healthcheck_server (HealthcheckServer): Server for monitoring application health.
        notifier (Notifier): Service for sending notifications and alerts.
        scheduler (Scheduler): Component for scheduling periodic tasks.
        plex (PlexServer): Interface for interacting with the Plex Media Server.
