    """The subset of an Episode that the post-refresh consumers actually read.

    refresh_library_cache() used to hand back live plexapi Episode objects at
    roughly 12KB each, so a bulk part-key churn retained the whole library
    (~790MB on a 65,925-episode server) and got the process OOM-killed. These
    measure ~242 bytes.

    Building one issues no requests, but only for an Episode whose fields are
    populated. Reading a field that is None on a partial object makes plexapi
    reload the whole item over the network (base.py:657), and librarySectionTitle
    is None on every episode a section search returns. iter_episodes stamps it
    from the owning section for exactly this reason; without that, building refs
    for a full library costs one metadata request per episode.

    Note show_title comes from grandparentTitle, which is NOT always the same as
    show().title: a show with an empty title reports grandparentTitle = None.

    Movies use the same shape (media_type "movie"): the show and season/episode
    fields are None and title carries the movie's name.
